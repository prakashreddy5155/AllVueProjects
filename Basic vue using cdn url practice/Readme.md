### v-show: 
#### This is to conditionally display something only when the passed value into v-show is true, or else it wont display that. if the value passed to v-show is false then the css property will be set as visibility:none, but it will be there in the DOM.

### v-if: 
#### This is to render the component only if the condition is satisfied, if the condition is not satisfied then the component for which we attached v-if that component itself is not rendered and wont be there in the DOM. the value that we pass to v-if is true then it renders or else dont render the component at all, if already rendered, then it destroys the component. and also we can use the ladder for this just like how we use in javascript like if, else if else like that.here it changes a little, v-if, v-else-if, v-else like that.

### v-else-if: 
#### used as a chain with v-if 

### v-else 
#### used as a chain with v-if or v-else-if
