### personal[1.0] - used script setup so that we dont have to manually mention export default {} and setup() and return{} as basic things we dont need to do, but also using setup it optimises the bundle and increses the performance. vue does all of these under the hood.

### personal[1.3] - props validation, we can validate the type of the props using defineProps({propNameComing:type, propNameComing: type}) 
#### example: const props = defineProps({name:String,phone:Number})
#### if we pass <contact name="om sai prakash" :phone="123123" :ownerName="1234user"> </contact>
#### if we want to pass a number and it should treat it like a string but we have used v-bind:ownerName or :ownerName in this scenario we need to make :ownerName="'1234user'" like this, we need to use single quotes inside.
